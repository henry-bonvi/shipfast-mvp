## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "7 days isn't enough time" | "For a full product, no. For an MVP to validate? It's perfect. We focus on core features." |
| "Too cheap to be good" | "We're efficient, not cheap. Same stack as $20k agencies, just less meetings and overhead." |
| "What about maintenance?" | "30 days bug fixes included. After that, you can hire devs or we can discuss ongoing support." |
| "I've been burned by devs before" | "That's why we offer a day-3 refund. No risk to try us." |
