# Case Study: TaskBoard

## Project Overview
**Client:** Internal project  
**Timeline:** 5 days  
**Budget:** N/A (internal build)

## The Challenge
Needed a simple, self-hosted project management tool that didn't require a subscription or complex setup. Trello-style boards without the SaaS overhead.

## The Solution
Built TaskBoard - a full-featured Kanban board app with:

- Drag-and-drop task management
- Multiple boards and lists
- User authentication
- Real-time updates
- Mobile responsive design

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vue.js 3 + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Laravel 12 (PHP 8.4)
- **Database:** SQLite (simple deployment)
- **Hosting:** Self-hosted or any PHP host

## Timeline Breakdown

| Day | Work Completed |
|-----|----------------|
| 1 | Project setup, auth, database schema |
| 2 | Board CRUD, list management |
| 3 | Task cards, drag-and-drop |
| 4 | UI polish, mobile responsive |
| 5 | Testing, deployment, documentation |

## Results
- Fully functional in 5 days
- Zero ongoing costs (self-hosted)
- Easy to customize and extend

## Key Learnings
1. Laravel + Vue is a powerful combo for rapid development
2. Tailwind CSS drastically speeds up UI work
3. SQLite is perfect for simple apps that don't need scale
