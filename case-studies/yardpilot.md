# Case Study: YardPilot

## Project Overview
**Client:** Vista Lawn Care (internal)  
**Timeline:** Ongoing development  
**Type:** Full SaaS product

## The Challenge
Running a lawn care business involves constant juggling:
- Scheduling jobs across multiple crews
- Sending reminders to clients
- Creating quotes and invoices
- Tracking customer history
- Managing recurring services

Existing CRMs were either too complex (Salesforce) or too generic (HubSpot) for the lawn care industry.

## The Solution
Built YardPilot - a CRM designed specifically for lawn care and home service businesses:

### Core Features
- **Job Scheduling** - Drag-and-drop calendar with crew assignments
- **Client Management** - Full customer database with service history
- **Automated Reminders** - SMS/email notifications before appointments
- **Quoting & Invoicing** - One-click quotes, professional invoices
- **Route Optimization** - Plan efficient daily routes
- **Recurring Jobs** - Set up weekly/fortnightly schedules

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Hosting:** Vercel + Railway
- **Integrations:** Stripe, Twilio SMS, Google Maps

## What Makes It Different
1. **Industry-specific** - Built for lawn care, not generic CRM
2. **Simple UI** - Tradies can use it without training
3. **Mobile-first** - Works on phone in the field
4. **Affordable** - Priced for small businesses, not enterprises

## Results
- Used daily by Vista Lawn Care
- Saved 5-10 hours/week on admin
- Zero missed appointments with auto-reminders

## Learnings
1. Talk to users before building - we ARE the user
2. Simple beats feature-rich for SMBs
3. Mobile experience is non-negotiable for field workers
